As you can see from above, this is a Sam Loyd Sliding Block Puzzle.

What you should do is to return the puzzle from whatever the initial state is to a ordered state from 1 to 15.

Here, we used a Object-Orientated approach.

"GameState.java" defines a new Object called GameState.

"Play.java" uses a BFS to carry out a brute-force search to find the path.
